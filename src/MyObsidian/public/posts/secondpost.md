## Beitar Jerusalem
Beitar Jerusalem Football Club (Hebrew: מועדון כדורגל בית"ר ירושלים, romanized: Moadon Kaduregel Beitar Yerushalayim), commonly known as Beitar Jerusalem (בית"ר ירושלים) or simply as Beitar (בית"ר), is an Israeli football club based in the city of Jerusalem, that plays in the Israeli Premier League, the top tier in Israeli football. The club has traditionally worn kit colours of yellow and black. The team has played its home matches in Teddy Stadium. The stadium is the largest stadium in Israel with a capacity of 34,000.

The club is one of _**the most popular**_ in Israel and is among the Israeli clubs with the highest number of fans in the country. The club was founded in 1936 by Shmuel Kirschstein and David Horn, who chaired the similarly named Betar branch in Jerusalem. Several team members were also part of the outlawed Irgun and Lehi militias closely associated with the right-wing Revisionist Zionism movement. Beitar's fans have become a highly controversial political symbol in Israeli football culture, unofficially aligned with the Revisionist Zionist movement and to the right-wing Likud party. The club, whose fanbase is notorious for its anti-Arab racism and anti-Muslim religious bigotry, remains the only one in the Israel Premier League to have never signed an Arab player, although the club signed four non-Arab Muslim players in the past.


## Stadiums
### Former Stadiums
Beitar held its first games as an professional football team in the "Dajani field", which was located in the old Katamon neighborhood. After the War of Independence and the establishment of the State of Israel, the team's home was officially moved to the YMCA Stadium, which has since become the team's regular home ground, until 1991, when the team moved to Teddy Stadium.

### Teddy Stadium

Teddy Stadium, Beitar's home ground.
In 1991, Beitar has moved to the Teddy Stadium, named after longtime Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek. Initially the stadium was two-sided and held 12,000 spectators. This was increased to 21,600 when a third side was completed in 1997. The fourth side of the stadium was completed in the summer of 2013 in anticipation of the UEFA under 21 championship hosted by Israel, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 34,000 seats.

The ground has been dubbed Gehinom (lit. Hell) by club supporters, for the hostile atmosphere it presents to visiting teams and their fans.

### Training Ground
All of the departments of Beitar Jerusalem train in the training complex at Beit Vagan. The complex includes locker rooms for the alumni group and the youth department, gyms, physiotherapy rooms, dining room, cloakrooms and treatment rooms. The complex contains three training fields, two of them with synthetic grass. Each of the fields has two Tribunes on both sides, and all contain a total of about 750 seats.

The club's offices have been in the complex since 2009, and there is a fan shop inside the complex that sells cheerleading and merchandise products for the group's fans.
