# Obsidian-11ty
[Demo](https://obsidian-11ty.netlify.app/) site.

This project has created as a platform for publishing selected posts/notes of your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault using the front-meter data. It uses the beautiful [Eleventy, as static site generator platform](https://www.11ty.dev/). 

The main features that makes the Obsidian so cool and implemented here, are: 
- Turn Wikilinks `[[links]]` as well as MDLinks `[links](links.md)` into HTML links
- Images display with custom width
- Mermaid.js charts 
- Backlinks
- Search option
and etc.
