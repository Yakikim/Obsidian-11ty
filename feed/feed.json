<pre><code class="language-">const publishAttachementsDir = 'attch';\n</code></pre>
\n<p>for every attachments directory you have to map it to the <code>_site/&lt;publishAttachementsDir&gt;</code> directory.<br />\nSo below this line you can add as many mapping as needded for your attachments folders you may like to share from your vault to your site.<br />\nIt can be done through:</p>\n
<pre><code class="language-">eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy({&lt;fromDir&gt;:&lt;toDir&gt;});\n</code></pre>
\n<p>for example:</p>\n
<pre><code class="language-">eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy({&quot;src/MyObsidian/public/attachments&quot;:`${publishAttachementsDir}`});\n</code></pre>
